# Hyperbolic Orbifold Tutte Embeddings

Matlab code implementing the [Siggraph Asia 2016 paper, "Hyperbolic Orbifold Tutte Embeddings"](https://noamaig.github.io/html/projects/hyperbolic/hyperbolic_low.pdf).

An extension of Tutte's embedding to hyperbolic domains, namely hyperbolic orbifolds which enable seamless parameterization and mapping.


###Example scripts:
- `example_embed_mesh_sphere` - map a spherical mesh to a hyperbolic orbifold.
- `example_embed_mesh_disk` - map a disk mesh to a hyperbol
- `script_embed_disk` - map a mesh with disk topology to a disk orbifold.
- `script_surface_map_spheres` - use the sphere orbifold embedding to compute a seamless, conformal map between two human heads which interpolates 3 given correspondences, and then visualize the map with a cute animation of a morph between the two meshes.
- `script_surface_map_disk` - use the disk orbifold embedding to compute a conformal map between two disk-meshes which interpolates 3 designated points on the boundary.

###Main high-level functions:
- `flatten_sphere` - embed a sphere mesh to a sphere orbifold. 
- `flatten_disk` - embed a disk mesh to a disk orbifold. 
- `map_spheres` - compute a map between two sphere meshes using the orbifold embeddings.
- `map_disks` - compute a map between two disk meshes using the orbifold embeddings.

There are 17 Euclidean orbifolds, of which only the 4 sphere orbifolds, and 2 disk orbifolds are implemented here. The 11 other cases can be easily implemented, if one wishes, by extending the cutting mechanism (needs to produce a cut-graph that opens the mesh into a disk) and the appropriate boundary conditions.
